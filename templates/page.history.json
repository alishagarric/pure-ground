It didn’t revolve around diet fads or buzzwords or pretty packaging on grocery store shelves, but instead came from one place—our vision of a world where growers, manufacturers, and consumers all came together in the name of better ingredients, sustainable practices, and a happier, healthier planet. </p><p>We first founded Pure Ground Ingredients in 2011, but our story starts nearly 20 years prior. Having grown up in a family whose business was fair-trade herbal tea, we always understood the importance of fair-trade—a program that gives products stable prices, ultimately helping farmers and their communities thrive in the face of unpredictable markets. But, what we noticed at the time was a major void in fair-trade ingredients. Fair-trade coffee, tea, and sugar were all readily available...but that was about it. We knew almost immediately that we wanted to help bring a wider range of high-quality, fair-trade, certified-organic ingredients to consumers—and in order to do that, we knew we needed to start at the source: growers around the globe. So, we packed our bags and embarked on the first of many adventures.</p>"
