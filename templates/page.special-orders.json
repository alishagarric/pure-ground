Sometimes called a pre-order or backorder, a Special Order is an order that can be purchased in advance of when it arrives to our distribution centre. Special Orders let you secure items before we have them in stock. As soon as we have your Special Order ready, we’ll ship it to you directly.<\/p>"}},"question-1":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"When will my Special Order ship?","text":"<p>We provide an approximate shipping date for each Special Order item — check the yellow notification on Special Order products to find this date. While we do our very best to ensure your order is shipped on or before this date, sometimes things can take a little longer than expected due to supply chain issues. Once your order does ship, you can expect to receive it in 1–4 business days, depending on whether you selected standard, express or priority shipping.<\/p>"}},"question-2":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"What happens if my Special Order is delayed?","text":"<p>We’re so sorry — waiting is no fun. We definitely haven’t forgotten your order, it’s just that global supply chain issues mean delays are often out of our control. Our Concierge team will let you know about any delays. Also note that your Order History will always reference the original expected shipping date. If something changes, we’ll reach out by email.<\/p>"}},"question-3":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"When do I have to pay for Special Orders?","text":"<p>We authorize your credit card for the full amount when you place your order, but you will NOT be charged until your order ships. Don't worry if more than one authorization shows up on your card — your credit card may be re-authorized by your bank periodically to make sure the charge will go through upon shipment . Please note that if the card does not have adequate funds when your bank attempts re-authorization, your order will unfortunately be cancelled.<\/p>"}},"question-4":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Can I cancel my Special Order?","text":"<p>If you need to cancel, please email us at <a href=\"mailto:service@example.com\" title=\"mailto:service@example.com\">service@example.com<\/a> or, if you’re in North America, call us at 1-234-EXAMPLE (123-4567).<\/p>"}},"question-5":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"Can I modify my Special Order?","text":"<p>Sorry, but we unfortunately cannot make modifications to Special Orders.<\/p>"}},"dee7b7f5-3678-4a46-8ed9-346170c0a070":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"What payment methods are accepted?","text":"<p>We accept credit cards and Gift Cards. Unfortunately, we’re not able to accept Apple Pay, Afterpay or Paypal for Special Orders.<br\/><br\/>A note on Gift Cards: the cost of your Special Order will be deducted from the current balance of your Gift Card. If the total amount of the purchase is more than your current Gift Card balance, the owing amount will be charged to your credit card once the item has been shipped.<\/p>"}},"787770f5-6616-47d4-bae0-480ff1a9adf8":{"type":"question","settings":{"title":"I keep getting an error at the checkout while trying to pay with a Gift Card. Why is that?","text":"<p>This error may be due to having more than one Special Order item in your cart. Currently, we can only process Gift Card payments that contain a single Special Order item. If you are trying to place an order for multiple items, and wish to use a Gift Card, please call us at 1-234-EXAMPLE (123-4567). We'll do our very best to help!<\/p>"}}},"block_order":["question-0","question-1","question-2","question-3","question-4","question-5","dee7b7f5-3678-4a46-8ed9-346170c0a070","787770f5-6616-47d4-bae0-480ff1a9adf8"],"settings":{"heading":"","heading_size":"h2","narrow":true,"secondary_background":false,"show_divider":false,"padding_top":0,"padding_bottom":72}}},"order":["main","faq"]}
